"What we know is a drop. What we don't know is an ocean."
(Sir Isaac Newton)

A very long time ago I did calculate the perihelion motion of planets assuming
a relativistically higher mass of the sun and therefore a higher resulting
force on the planets compared to Newton. I assumed the same relativistic
increase of the mass and therefore the force as the one of an electric field of
a moving charge which I did calculated a short time before. When I remembered
this some days ago I dug out that old stuff and had a look at that again.
And here is the somewhat unexpected result that I did end up with.

The idea at that time was that the perihelion precession resulted from the
increased angle of deflection according to the special relativistic higher
gravitational force of the sun on the planets. Once you imagine the orbit of
the planets as a spool of wire and the bending of the wire is slightly
increased at one point then the entire remaining spool of wire rotates
according to that additional bend as the perihelion of the planetary orbit
should.

Here is my preceding calculation of the force between two point charges moving
past each other at a distance r

[1]    B  = µ H = µ q v /(4 π r²)
[2]    FR = e e /(4 π r² ε)
[3]    FL = e v x B
[4]    FL = e v x µ e v/(4 π r²)
[5]    F  = FR + FL
[6] -> F  = FR(1 + FL/FR)
[7] -> F  = FR(1 + µ ε v²)
[8] -> F  = FR(1 + v²/c²)

There are:

 e  = electric point charge 
 B  = magnetic flux density
 H  = magnetic field strength
 F  = resultant total force
 FR = force between stationary charges at a distance r from each other
 FL = Lorentz force when charges move past each other at a distance r
      with a velocity v
 µ  = magnetic field constant
 ε  = electric field constant
 π  = circle number Pi
 v  = (Newtonian, non-relativistic) velocity

The electric field force thus increases with (1 + v²/c²) whereby it
corresponds to the force of the magnetic field of the moving electric charge
and is identical to it.

Since the deflection angle from a straight line by a gravitational force that
is acting perpendicular to the direction of motion is proportional to the
force for small forces and deflections, a relativistic increment of the
gravitational force should consequently result in a perihelion precession that
is proportional to right that increasing force.

The non-relativistic total deflection angle for a circular orbit is 2π. The
orbital velocity of a body according to Newton is calculated as

[9]     vb = √(G M / r)

and the escape velocity, which is why the sun is also more energetic and thus
more massive from the point of view of the Mercury orbit than for distant
observers is

[10]    v2 = √(2 G M / r)

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the sun, and r is the
orbital radius or the major semi-axis of the planet's orbit. Since both
velocity vectors are perpendicular to each other a vectorial addition results
in a total velocity of

[11]    vg = √(3 G M / r)

With a relativistic increase in the gravitational force by the factor (1+v²/c²)
an increase in force of v²/c² results in the additional angle of deflection
Pd = 2 π (v²/c²) per revolution. Because of this the precession of perihelion
per revolution is expected to be

[12] -> Pd = 2 π 3 G M / r / c²

Although this is derived using the forces only and neglecting the ellipse but
corresponds exactly to the results of the general theory of relativity and
therefore it does not contradict general theory of relativity because the
energy and forces depend purely on the observer and the atoms in the
gravitational field are known to be stretched the same as the time flow.
The sun is therefore smaller and richer in energy and mass for the planets than
for a distant observer. According to the elongation of the atoms, the orbit is
shorter from the perspective of a planet by exactly the same amount that it is
longer due to the gravitational elongation of space. That's what I thought.
The above equation should only be valid for velocities much smaller than c.
For velocities close to c the equation unusable and for higher velocities the 
term (1 + v²/c²) for (Newtonian) velocities should be replaced by the square
of the Lorentz factor (1 + v²/(c²-v²)) which is behind that. The difference of
this is for typical cross-sections of electrical conductors negligibly small.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to realize that the Lorentz force and therefore
magnetic fields are relativistic effects. For the perihelion precession of the
planets in the solar system the difference can be ignored as well.

But does this mean that everything was already clear and in line with our
expectations? Unfortunately not, because although the perihelion rotation was
pretty correct, the relativistic mass increase and electrical force increase
were not proportional to the Lorentz factor γ but obviously to the square
of the Lorentz factor which is γ² and thus the relativistic mass and energy
increase should happen according to γ² as well but not by γ only as postulated
by Einstein according to E=mc²γ! 
Reason enough to have a closer look at this even that I guess that many
physicist may be somewhat upset about my previous highly simplifying special
relativistic calculations of the gravitational forces and the perihelion
precession already.

A brief hint for all readers regarding the relativistic Lorentz factor γ.
The notation γ=√(1 + v²/(c²-v²)) is sometimes preferred over the more common
form γ=√(1/(1 - (v²/c²))). This is because the former notation more clearly
separates the static and relativistic growing components within that term. If
one memorizes both versions as being equivalent, this simplifies the conversion
of simple relativistic equations considerably. Slightly other forms of γ that
we face sometimes in physical equations are γ=√(c²/(c²-v²)) and
γ=√(1 + v²γ²/c²).

If we assume a total energy of E=mc²γ² as missing extension to Einstein's known
E=mc²γ and want to calculate the kinetic energy by subtracting the energy of
the rest mass then we see that the equation for relativistic energy is still
not correct, because the following results

[13]    kE = E - mc²
[14]    kE = mc²γ² - mc²
[15]    kE = mc² (1 + v²/(c²-v²)) - mc²
[16]    kE = mv² (1 / (1-(v²/c²))
[17]    kE = mv² (1 + v²/(c²-v²))
[18] -> kE = mv²γ²

In the case that E=mc² applies, the energy of the Newtonian approximation of
the kinetic energy would be too large by a factor of 2. Therefore in case of γ²,
the energy of the rest mass can only be half as large as Einstein did postulate
with E=mc²γ most likely E=mc²γ²/2. So there would be something wrong and we
should derive the matter for this more completely.

From the known equation for the relativistic momentum p=mvγ and a momentum-
dependent kinetic energy kE=p²/(2m), the relativistic kinetic energy results
as following 

[19]    kE = p²/(2m)
[20]    p  = mvγ
[21]    p² = m²v²γ²
[22]    p² = m²v²(1 + v²/(c²-v²))
[23]    p² = m²v²((c²-v² + v²)/(c²-v²))
[24]    p² = m²c²(v²/(c²-v²))
[25]    p² = m²c²(γ²-1)
[26]    p² = m²c²γ² - m²c²
[27] -> kE = mc²γ²/2 - mc²/2

The energy of the rest mass that the kinetic energy results relativistically
according to γ² is therefore mc²/2. If we add this to the kinetic energy then
we get the total energy as

[28] -> E = kE + mc²/2
[29] -> E = mc²γ²/2
        ===========

OK - this could be the solution. In this case E=mc²γ would be wrong and should
be replaced by the equation E=mc²γ²/2 . Using this relativistic total energy
the kinetic energy can be obtained as a check by subtracting the rest mass
energy from the total energy as following 

[30]    kE = E - mc²/2
[31]    kE = mc²γ²/2 - mc²/2
[32]    kE = mc²/2 (1 + v²/(c²-v²)) - mc²/2
[33]    kE = mv²/2 (1 / (1-(v²/c²))
[34]    kE = mv²/2 (1 + v²/(c²-v²))
[35] -> kE = mv²γ²/2
        ============

The Newtonian approximation of kinetic energy seems correctly now and the
equation kE=mv²γ²/2 seems even more correct because the equation for a
velocity v² also contains the required relativistic correction factor γ².
A mass-energy equivalence exists according E=mc²γ²/2 as well.

We have to check of course whether this equation is valid and generally
applicable. For this we should have a look at the energy balance of a free fall
first. The following applies to the vertical a free fall of a mass for the
classical lifting work W

[36]    W   = mgh

and according to the conservation of energy

[37]    E'  = E - W
[38]    E   = E' + W

For the kinetic energy and the resulting velocity of a free fall applies

[39]    mv²/2 = mgh
[40]    v²    = 2gh

This results for a free falling mass in according to E=mc² of Einstein in

[41]    E   = mc² + mgh
[42]    E   = mc²(1 + gh/c²)

if v² << c² this is equivalent to

[43]    E   ≈ mc²√(1 + 2gh/c²)

That's known and matches the change of the frequency of photons. But E=mc²γ
can't be right if it comes to the relativistic increasing attraction forces
which which should be growing proportionally to γ².

If E=mc²γ²/2 applies then the Energy of a free falling mass should grow
according to γ² while the summary energy should match

[44]    E   = mc²/2 + mgh
[45]    E   = (mc²/2)(1 + 2gh/c²)

As we can see E=mc²γ²/2 matches our expectations regarding the kinetic energy
perfectly as well and we have to look much more into the datails.

In the cases above, we have

W  = classical lifting work
E  = initial energy of the photons or mass
E' = energy after a free fall of the height s
m  = rest mass
h  = height (lifting distance)
g  = gravitational acceleration
c  = speed of light

In case of  v << c there is obviously nearly no difference. Only if we care
about the growth of forces that results from the relativistic growing of energy
we'll find that electric and gravitational forces and therefore the related
energies should be growing proportionally to γ² instead of γ.

But doesn't the energy of photons change according to (1 + gh/c²) and wouldn't
be a perpetual motion machine possible? No, because since the frequency of
photons in the gravitational field only increases that much that clocks run
slower there and the frequency, wavelength and energy of photons in a
gravitational field obviously do not change. So it depends anything on change
of the inner energy of the clocks and their atoms solely. Of course the
frequency as well as the energy of those change according to γ of the velocity
of a free fall as we know. 

Despite the differences in the elapse of time, light also travels the same
local distance in the same time in the gravitational field due to the constancy
of the speed of light. Since the change in frequency of the photons can be
explained solely by the difference of the clocks, the clocks and their atoms
should be stretched by the same factor in gravitational field that the clocks
are running slower there. The size of atoms and atomic particles and their
Compton wavelength, should be increased by γ and thus proportionally to that
the duration of all transitions inside of of atoms should be slower by γ.
This reduces the frequency of atomic clocks and thus decrease the speed of the
passage of time there. Since atoms in the gravitational field are larger by γ,
the energy of the elementary particles is lowered by γ. Of course this
corresponds rather to E=mc²γ than to E=mc²γ²/2 which should be wrong, or
doesn't it? Of course the things aren't always that trivial as they seem at the
first glance. And since we are nearly convinced that E=mc²γ²/2 is the correct
equation, we only have to look where the missing energy according to our
expected change of γ² is.

The measurements of the Shapiro delay proved that the time required for photons
to cross a gravitational field is extended according γ² of the respective local
escape velocity. Slowing down the propagation of waves inevitably results in an
increase of their frequency that is inversely proportional to their propagation
speed. The frequency of the photons should therefore increase by γ² in relation
to the coordinate velocity. But since they are detected with an increase of the
frequency by γ means that the atoms have an energy that is by γ higher than it
should be according our assomed γ². So why does the energy of the atoms not
change by γ² but γ? What do we miss?

The answer is that physical interactions, such as gravity always involve more
than just one body. We had ignored the energy change of the atoms of the
attracting mass that decreases in summary the same amount that the energy of
the atoms of our atomic clocks decreases. If the attracting mass would match
the mass of our clock it would be pretty obviously to everyone that the atoms
of it are loosing the same amount of energy that the atoms of our clock do.
The kinetic energy during a free fall matches the change of the internal energy
of all involved masses. The distribution of the released kinetic energy, on the
other hand, is determined by the conservation of momentum. If E=mc²γ would
apply, half of the released energy therefore would be missing! Our equation for
the total energy before was incomplete because the energy change of the mass
that causes the gravitational acceleration was missing in it! So E=mc²γ²/2
seems to be correct but not E=mc²γ. 

Let's recapitulate the basics of the theory of special relativity that are
basing on the confirmation that the speed of light is the same in any reference
system and any direction.

Our moving observer has upgraded his old Einstein train to a stylish travelling
sphere with a reflecting inner surface. At the center of the sphere is a
lighting system and sends at the touch of a button simultaneous pulses of light
in all directions, which are reflected by the reflecting surface of the sphere
and are received simultaneously by the sensors in the center of the sphere on
their return. All light pulses are travelling at c for each observer and after
being reflected by the sphere they are also received simultaneously by the
sensors afterwards from the perspective of all observers.

Let's start with the derivation of the Lorentz factor. A pulse of light travels
vertically upwards and becomes received at the center of the sphere again after
being reflected by sphere and for this after two times travelling the radius r.
During this time, the sphere has moved the distance 2s at the speed v for
stationary observers and the light did not travel vertically for those observer
but diagonally to the ceiling of the sphere and back twice the distance a,
which is longer than the radius r. For a sketch of such an ellipse see
https://github.com/klux21/science_stuff/blob/master/dao_of_relativity.png
According to the Pythagorean theorem, the following applies

[49]    a² = s² + r²

And for the time difference t of the stationary observer and t' of the moving
observer, the following applies

[50]    (t*c)² = (t*v)² + (t'*c)²
[51]    c²t'² = t²(c²-v²)
[52]    t = t' √(c²/(c²-v²))
[53]    t = t'γ

The moving clocks of our traveller therefore are running by γ slower.
Similar applies to the paths of the light

[54]    r² = a² - s²
[55]    r  = a √(1 - s²/a²)
[56]    r  = a √(1 - (v*t)²/(c*t)²)
[57]    a  = rγ

Therefore the light path a, which the observer at rest registers, is by a
factor of γ longer and that path is not completely perpendicular to the
direction of movement as it is from the perspective of the traveller. But what
about the light rays in the other directions? Because they are all emitted at
the same time and reflected by the sphere at the same time and are received
afterwards at the same time, they all must have travelled the same distance at
c in all directions but this distance is a different one for both observers.
This means for our stationary observer that all reflection points are on the
surface of a perfect spheroid where they did arrive after different time spans.
The focal points of that spheroid's perfectly elliptical longitudinal section
are the positions where the light pulses are emitted and received from the view
of the stationary observers.

All paths of the light pulses in the different directions between the two focal
points therefore have the same total length of 2a. That's why 2a is the total
length of the spheroid for our stationary observer as well and which is longer
than the 2r which is the radius of the sphere for our traveller. That means
that in general all 2-way distances within the moving system are shorter by γ
from the point of view of that moving reference system, regardless of their
direction.

Because of the movement of the center of the sphere for the stationary observer
there exists an angle between the outward and return paths of the light and
the distance towards the sphere and back to it's center is by γ shorter for the
traveller than for our unmoved observer in all directions. The time it takes
for the photons to travel the two way distance to the sphere and back is by γ
shorter for our traveller as well for and for this his clocks are running by γ
slower in comparison to the clocks of the unmoved observer.

But doesn't that all contradict the Lorentz contraction? Not really. Of course
that requires the positions of the points to be measured at the same time. 
Well, we have already deduced the size of the reflecting ellipsoid that must
result from the reflection of the sphere's surface. We can also assume that
being at rest to fulfill that requirement and calculate the size of a co-moving
ellipsoid that our sphere may become when it reflects the light. Of course we
can as well deduce the size of an ellipsoid from which center the sending and
receival happens. Its height perpendicular to the direction of motion is of
course r and the length results from the distance that our sphere has travelled
while the light is travelling towards that. The sphere continues to move the
length s=vt and the distance between the focal point of the ellipsoid and its
edge is given by a+s in the direction of movement, where the edge of the sphere
is ahead of the photons, and a-s in the opposite direction, where the edge
moves towards the photons. The ratio of the velocities gives the radius r' of
the sphere. In direction of motion we have

[58]    r' = (a+s)-((a+s)/c)v
[59]    r' = (rγ+(rγ/c)v)-((rγ+(rγ/c)v)/c)v
[60]    r' = rγ((1+v/c)-(1+v/c)(v/c))
[61]    r' = rγ((1+v/c)*(1-v/c))
[62]    r' = rγ((c+v)*(c-v)/c²))
[63]    r' = rγ((c²+v²)/c²))
[64]    r' = rγ (1/γ²)
[65]    r' = r/γ
        ========

and in the opposite direction we have the following

[66]    r' = (a-s)+((a-s)/c)v
[67]    r' = rγ-(rγ/c)v)+((rγ-rγv/c)/c)v
[68]    r' = rγ(1-v/c)+rγ(1-v/c)(v/c)
[69]    r' = rγ ((1-v/c)*(1+v/c))
[70]    r' = rγ ((c-v)*(c+v)/c²)
[71]    r' = rγ ((c²-v²)/c²))
[72]    r' = rγ (1/γ²)
[73]    r' = r/γ
        ========

As we can see, according to our calculation, the sphere is shortened by γ, but
interacts with the photons as if it were γ² longer, even in the case of
reflections, which no longer corresponds to the law of reflection in case of a
shortened sphere. Is our sphere physically shorter and longer at the same time,
depending on what you look at? What's going on?
If photons are sent from the centre of the sphere to its edge and are
registered again at the centre after being reflected, the 2-way distance is by
γ² longer than the calculated shortened sphere. So what is true and where is
the solution to that riddle?
Well, that co-moving Lorentz contracted shpere where the position of all points
of the sphere are measured at the same time is a rather misleading idea and it
is by far better to rely on a 2 way distance measurement with light.
The sphere moves with the traveler and not a shortened sphere that causes a
stationary ellipse and neither the law of reflection nor the then inexplicable
Doppler shift or the slower clocks result logically from this and are speaking
for that approach . The effective physical length ratio of objects with l'/l=γ
(or with a/r=γ) is reciprocal to that of Lorentz contraction, even if this does
not correspond to the classical approach.


The matter is not so trivial, as can be seen from the directional dependence of
the wavelength of photons, which does not exist for the traveller. However we
can propose that the distance of the sphere from it's center remains the same
for all observers in all directions when measured by the number of wave length
of the emitted light. That's only possible if the distance of between the
center and the sphere transforms direction dependend. Based on this, the centre
M of the sphere corresponds to the focal point F when the light is emitted and
to the focal point F' in our sketch when it is received afterwards.

That real existing and for this applying relativistic stretching can be
measured directly by measuring the relativistic Doppler effect which can be
even explained that way and it is empirically already perfectly confirmed by
that as well. The relativistic Doppler shift provides information about the
change of lengths in a particular direction, because distances and the
frequency of light from the perspective of a traveler remain unchanged in all
directions compared to the ones at rest and so all distances measured by those
wavelengths of light within this inertial frame remain unchanged as well. When
measuring a length, the 2-way speed of light is usually relevant. For that the
distance in the two opposite directions need to be measured always and as we
already know, those distances in a moving frame are increasing by γ from the
view of a resting observer.

One paradox that no longer applies therefore is that of the speed limits.
The same relative speed is measured in a moving system as in a stationary
system. If time passes more slowly in a moving system, the distances in the
moving system must be shorter by the same factor in order to measure the same
relative velocity within it. Moving a distance s witin the resting system takes
only the shorter time t'=t/γ within the moving system but at the same time the
distance s withing the resting system is measured with the by γ enlarged scale
of the moving system that is s'=s/γ and the measured velocity as the quotient
of both remains the same. In case of the Lorentz contraction the equation
became v=γ²s'/t' with that unexplainable γ² in it.

The collisions of the photons with the surface of the sphere of course happen
equally for all observers and measured by the wavelengths of the photons also
after the same distance but they are solely simultaneous for the traveller.
Supposed the traveller emits photons with his light system in the direction of
movement. Between the beginning of this transmission and its end, the traveller
has continued to move at v for the stationary observer. The wavelength for the
stationary observer is therefore shorter or longer by that distance that the
traveller has moved during the begin and the end of the transmission of a
photon.
The ratio of the wavelengths is therefore (c-v)/c in the direction of movement
and (c+v)/c in the opposite direction of movement. For the stationary observer,
the measured frequency of the photons is also lower by the amount by which the
traveller's clocks are slower, i.e. f=f'/(γ(c-v)/c) in the direction of
movement and f=f'/(γ(c+v)/c) in the opposite direction and f=f'/γ perpendicular
to the direction of movement.
This has also been confirmed empirically and allows us to conduct another
thought experiment. When electrons and positrons annihilate, two photons of the
same frequency are released, which contain the total energy of the particles
and are emitted in opposite directions. How does their total energy change if
our traveller lets the particles annihilate and one photon is emitted in the
direction of motion and one in the opposite direction?

[74]    E = hf/(γ(c-v)/c) + hf/(γ(c+v)/c)
[75]    E = hf/(1/(γ(c-v)/c) + 1/(γ(c+v)/c))
[76]    E = hf((cγ(c+v) + cγ(c-v)) / (γ(c-v) γ(c+v))
[77]    E = hf(2c² / (γ(c-v)(c+v))
[78]    E = hf(2c² / (γ(c²-v²))
[79]    E = hf(2γ² / γ)
[80]    E = 2hfγ
        ========

The energy of both photons is therefore by γ higher for the stationary
observer. That would perfectly confirm E=mc²γ if the energy of the particles
were not reduced by γ due to time dilatation. The energy would be γ² higher if
moving objects and therefore also atoms were not γ larger and therefore lower
in energy for an observer at rest and if the time flow in the moving system
wouldn't be by γ slower for him, what neither E=mc²γ nor E=mc²γ²/2 care about.
The equation E=mc²γ²/2 seems correct in such a strange way that E=mc²γ is
usually coincidentally right as well because half of the complete change of
mass or energy is unknowingly ignored if that applies.

But what about the muons in the Earth's atmosphere? How can those reach the
ground? The speed of light is only the maximum speed if distance and time are
measured in the same inertial frame. However, a body never moves relative to
its own inertial frame, but always moves all distances in a reference frames
other than its own, and here there is no speed limit, just as in Newtonian
mechanics, since γ can be arbitrarily large and the time difference of the
moving system for traveling a distance in the stationary system can therefore
become arbitrarily short, as well as the distance s, measured by the longer
scale of the moving system.  
And what does this look like in the reference system of the muons? Doesn't the
distance get longer for them? Sure, but what gets longer is the 2-way distance
only. Distances in the direction of movement are shortened by √((c-v)/(c+v))
while they are longer by √((c+v)/(c-v)) in the opposite direction, because that
corresponds to the change of the wavelengths of light in those directions.

As a confirmation of E=mcγ there have been several test of the derivation of
relativistic electrons in a magnetic field for measuring the relation between
the electric charge and a growing particle mass which has found to be growing
according to E=mcγ. Within the related calculations the relativistic growth
of the forces of the electric or magnetic fields has always been ignored and
a growing of the mass according γ was assumed. But as we already know are
the forces of the electric field growing according to γ². Therefore the
centrifugal force Fz should grow according γ³ to be in agreement to the results
of this experiments. The equation of the centrifugal force is given as

[81]    Fz = mv²/r

A relativistic correction of the velocity and the radius gives 

[82]    Fz = mv²γ²/(r/γ)
[83]    Fz = mv²γ³/r

Because the the electric field forces are growing by γ² and the centrifugal
force grows by γ³ and is increasing be factor γ more than the electric field
forces. There is no need for any increasing mass as once postulated by
Einstein to explain the results.

Electrons in a magnetic field move on a circular path where the center is at
rest for both the electrons and the observer. The radius of the path is
perpendicular to the direction of motion and by γ shorter for the moving
electrons. But if the increase of the centrifugal force results purely
geometrically why are the electrical and gravitational forces increasing by γ²
as well? Let's have a look at Newton's law of gravitation and the
gravitational force Fg for that

[84]    Fg = G m1 m2 / r²

As we can see, the force between the two masses m1 and m2 is proportionally to
1/r² and because r becomes shorter by γ for a moving mass the force increases
relativistically by γ²

[85]    Fg = G m1 m2 γ² / r²

The same applies for the force between electric charges that we found in
equation [2] before. The missing factor γ²γ² of the Lorentz force on the
right-hand side of equation [3] becomes also obvious and obviously a γ²
according to γ=√(1 + v²γ²/c²) was missing as a relativistic correction of the
velocity in equation [8] before as well.
Of course you find that way also E=mv²γ²/2 for the kinetic energy but there
are the things not that trivial as we already know.

E=mc² should be pretty well validated and acknowledged in nuclear physics e.g.
by Rainville et al. 2005 "A direct test of E=mc²"
( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/
7399131_World_Year_of_Physics_A_direct_test_of_Emc2 )
Despite of the claims of that paper a mathematical check shows that some of
the measured wavelengths were corresponding to E=1.35 mc² instead of E=mc².
According to E=mc², the wavelength for silicon should be 0.19841e-12m instead
of 0.14632e-12m and for sulphur 0.19321e-12m instead of 0.14347e-12m.
The for E=mc² too short wave lengths are also confirmed by Dewey et al. 2006
"Precision measurement of the Si29, S33, and Cl36 binding energies"
( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/
238973414_Precision_measurement_of_the_Si29_S33_and_Cl36_binding_energies )
The reported energies are there too high as well and only the binding energy of
deuterons corresponds to E=mc². E=mc² is therefore a rough estimation only and
there are obviously other factors besides the mass difference that are relevant
for the energy balance of atomic processes. Therefore an energy equivalent of
E=0.5mc² for only the mass cannot be ruled out. Of course that results in case
of E=mc²γ²/2 solely from the relativistic equation of the kinetic energy which
does not tell anything about a conversion of a rest mass and any assignment of
the Lorentz factor to the mass happens purely arbitrary and is misleading only.

Unfortunately I didn't find  much information regarding empirical validations
of E=mc² in the internet. Only the information about the Bertozzi experiment
is very good. I even found a very interesting video from 1962 showing how he
carried out the experiment with a slide rule and the Stone Age technology of
that time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0BOpiMQXQA .
It's quite interesting to watch and the squeaking V-belt of the old-fashioned
motor of his vacuum pump quite funny. Unfortunately, his results were too
imprecise in order to be able to differentiate conclusively between E=mc²γ and
E=mc²γ²/2. However, if you look at his ancient technique, that inaccuracy is
not surprising.

Beside of that I found the information about M. Lund and U. I. Uggerhøj 2007
‘Experimental special relativity with a meter stick and a clock’.
The description of the experiment and the results are not so detailed and there
is only a diagram with the measured values. The results correspond to E=mc²γ
with a slight deviation downwards at energies above 1MeV, but this may also be
due to the experimental setup. But the results rule out a growth of the
velocity according to E=mc²γ²/2 or E=mc²γ/2 in in conjunction with an
unchanging mass.

But what about the perihelion movement? The calculation was wrong because it
did not take into account the relativistically growing centrifugal force and
the Shapiro-delay. I didn't even know that time that those even exist.
However, since the centrifugal and gravitational force are both proportional
to the mass, a relativistic change of the mass would not lead to any change of
the orbits of the planets. But in addition to the Shapiro-delay and the growth
of the centrifugal force and the relativistically stretched orbit must be taken
into account, which together give quite the same value of 41.162” per century
for Mercury.
